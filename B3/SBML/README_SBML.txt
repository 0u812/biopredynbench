SBML (Systems Biology Markup Language) is a machine-readable format for representing models, based on XML. Information about SBML can be found in http://sbml.org/Main_Page

Note that the SBML implementations contain descriptions of the models, but NOT data nor optimization settings. Hence they are not complete descriptions of a parameter estimation problem.

SBML files can be imported from a number of applications, including COPASI and Matlab.
