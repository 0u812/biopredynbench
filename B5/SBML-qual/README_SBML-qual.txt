SBML (Systems Biology Markup Language) is a machine-readable format for representing models, based on XML. Information about SBML can be found in http://sbml.org/Main_Page

Note that the SBML implementations contain descriptions of the models, like dynamics and initial conditions.
But they do NOT contain data aligned with the model for parameter estimation, or optimization settings etc. 
Hence they can not provide a complete descriptions of a parameter estimation problem.

SBML files can be imported from a number of applications, including COPASI and Matlab.

Model B5 is represented in SBML using the SBML-qual format. SBML-qual is an extension of SBML developed for qualitative models of biological networks. Information about SBML-qual can be found in the following publication:
